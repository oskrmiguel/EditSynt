class Checkpoint(object):
    """
    The Checkpoint class manages the saving and loading of a model during training. It allows training to be suspended
    and resumed at a later time (e.g. when running on a cluster using sequential jobs).
    To make a checkpoint, initialize a Checkpoint object with the following args; then call that object's save() method
    to write parameters to disk.
    Args:
        model (seq2seq): seq2seq model being trained
        optimizer (Optimizer): stores the state of the optimizer
        epoch (int): current epoch (an epoch is a loop through the full training vocab_data)
        step (int): number of examples seen within the current epoch
        input_vocab (Vocabulary): vocabulary for the input language
        output_vocab (Vocabulary): vocabulary for the output language
    Attributes:
        CHECKPOINT_DIR_NAME (str): name of the checkpoint directory
        TRAINER_STATE_NAME (str): name of the file storing trainer states
        MODEL_NAME (str): name of the file storing model
        INPUT_VOCAB_FILE (str): name of the input vocab file
        OUTPUT_VOCAB_FILE (str): name of the output vocab file
